Each module is buildable via blueprint which defines the values in the module
    Blueprints can be Researched.
        Research can change both parameters and material costs of the items produced.


blueprint object => research function => blueprint object *DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE*


How does composition factor in to the need to represent both the materials and parameters of the modules?

Pile of basic objects (basic building materials) => blueprint lists these quantities => factory consumes these quantities => module comes out
